# 连接词不等于 V-1
> 从属连词的个数等于 V-1

## 第二层
- I think(v.) that you are(v.) a rabbit and(第二层) that you are(v.) smart.

## 找错谓语
> ABB 型动词 eg: made 作 did(谓语 主动)/done(非谓语 被动)

## 找错连接词
eg: That man is a rabbit. 此处 That 为指示代词作限定词

## 省略
> 省略的本质：没有引导词时，句子结构也足够清晰

### 宾从第一个 that
eg: I think (that) you are a rabbit and that you are smart.

### 定从 关系代词（连接词）从句中作宾语
eg: The book (that) I bought yesterday is good.

### 定从中当先行词为 the way 时，从句完整，引导词可用 that,in which 或忽略
eg: I like the way (that/in which/省略) you lie

### 反向找省略的连接词
> 先找 v.，再往前找 S，再往前就是省略的引导词
> 句中不能省略引导词
eg: I think (that) he is right.

三大难点
- 主从
  - 引 + S(句子) + v.
  - eg: I think (that) what you did is of help.
- 主谓相隔
  - 引 + S + 后定 + v.
  - eg: I think (that) the boy wearing a green hat is a rabbit.
- 主语前有状语
  - 引 + 状 + S  + v.
  - eg: I think (that) from the beginning you are a rabbit.
